  Scenario: when a program with with valid data is uploaded, a Facebook post with a link to the project should be made
           and when the program is reported, the Facebook post should be removed again.
    When I upload a valid program
    Then the project should be posted to Facebook with message "test" and the correct project ID
    When I report the program
    Then the Facebook Post should be deleted

  @RealFacebook
  Scenario: When a program with an existing Facebook post is set invisible, then the Facebook post should be removed
    When I upload a valid program
    Then the project should be posted to Facebook with message "test" and the correct project ID
    When program "test" is not visible
    Then the Facebook Post should be deleted
