      | Superman | 123456   | cccccccccc | dev1@pocketcode.org |
      | Gangster | 123456   | cccccccccc | dev2@pocketcode.org |
    And there are programs:
      | id | name      | description             | owned by | downloads | apk_downloads | views | upload time      | version | language version | visible | remix_root |

    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # this is how the remix graph looks like according to the following forward remix relations (closure table):
    #              (1)
    #               \
    #               (2)_____
    #               / \     \
    #             (3) (4)   |       (8)
    #              | \ |    |        |
    #             (5) (6)__/        (9)
    #               \ /
    #               (7)
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And there are forward remix relations:
      | ancestor_id | descendant_id | depth |
      | 1           | 1             | 0     |
