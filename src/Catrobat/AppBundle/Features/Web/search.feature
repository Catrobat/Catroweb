  Background:
    Given there are users:

    And there are programs:

    And I am on "/pocketcode"

  Scenario: search for programs should work
    Given I fill in "search-input-header" with "prog"
    And I click "#search-header"
    Then I should see "Your search returned 4 results"
    And the "search-input-header" field should contain "prog"
    And the "search-input-footer" field should contain "prog"
    And the "searchbar" field should contain "prog"


  Scenario: footer search should work too
    Given I fill in "search-input-footer" with "mypro"
    And I click "#search-footer"
    Then I should see "Your search returned 2 results"
    And the "search-input-header" field should contain "mypro"
    And the "search-input-footer" field should contain "mypro"
    And the "searchbar" field should contain "mypro"

  @Mobile
  Scenario: search on mobile view
    Given the element "#search-header-mobile" should be visible
    And the element "#searchbar" should not be visible
    When I click "#search-header-mobile"
    Then the element "#search-header-mobile" should not be visible
    And the element "#searchbar" should be visible
    When I fill in "searchbar" with "prog"
