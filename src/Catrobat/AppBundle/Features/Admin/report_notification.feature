@admin
Feature: Admin Report Notification
  In order to get informed of an upload
  As a subscribed admin
  I want to get an email when a program is uploaded or reported

  Background:
    Given I am a valid user

Scenario: Email subscribed admins directly after report
  Given there are users:
    | name     |  email           |
    | Catrobat |  admin@catrob.at |
    | User1    |  dog@catrob.at   |
    | User2    |  dog2@catrob.at  |
  And there are programs:
    | id | name      |
    | 1  | program 1 |
    | 2  | program 2 |
    | 3  | program 3 |
  And there are notifications:
    |user     |upload   |report | summary |
    |Catrobat |1        |true   | 1       |
    |User1    |1        |0      | 0       |
    |User2    |0        |true   | 0       |
  And I activate the Profiler

  When I report program 1 with category "spam" and note "Bad Program"
  Then I should see 2 outgoing emails
  And I should see a email with recipient "admin@catrob.at"
  And I should see a email with recipient "dog2@catrob.at"
