 * Imagine that each Catrobat program is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks).
 * All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the
 * cakes and learn how to make them yourself! There are no secret recipes: the instructions on how to make these cakes
 * are open for anyone to use, reuse, modify, and serve as inspiration for new ideas... I mean cakes.
 *
 * You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients.
 * This freedom comes with two simple requirements:
 *
 * share your cakes along with the recipe
 * give credit to those who inspired you
 *
 *
 * In setting up the Catrobat community, we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning
 * and creativity within the community. By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon
 * one another's ideas and everyone will benefit.
 *
 * In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others.
 * On each program page, you can always download the original scripts for the program. If you remix a program
 * (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the Program Notes,
 * mentioning the people and program that inspired you.
 *
 * Learn more about the terms of use of the Catrobat online community on https://share.catrob.at/pocketcode/termsOfUse.
