  title: 'Licença para jogar – Dê crédito e partilhe'
  text1: Imagine that each Catrobat project is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks). All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
  text2: 'Não há receitas secretas: as instruções sobre como fazer estes bolos são abertas a todos para utilizar, reutilizar, modificar e servir de inspiração para novas ideias... ou melhor, bolos.'
  text3: "Pode comer os bolos bem como copiar as receitas de outras pessoas para fazer as suas próprias, talvez com ingredientes diferentes. Esta liberdade vem acompanhada de dois simples requisitos:"
  text4: "Na criação da comunidade Catrobat, decidimos adoptar esta abordagem, pois acreditamos que ela suporta a aprendizagem e a criatividade dentro da Comunidade. Através da partilha de receitas e ingredientes (guiões e arte), todos podem criar com base nas ideias uns dos outros. Assim, todos beneficiam."
  text5: In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each project page, you can always download the original scripts for the project. If you remix a project (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the project notes, mentioning the people and project that inspired you.
  text6: 'Saiba mais acerca dos termos de utilização da comunidade em linha Catrobat em %link-termsOfUse%.'
  list1:
    item1: partilhar os seus bolos juntamente com a receita
    item2: dar crédito aos que o inspiraram
  version: Versão 1.1, de 2 de Abril de 2013
termsOfUse:
  title: Termos de Utilização
  headline: Bem-vindo à comunidade Catrobat!
  text1: 'As part of the Catrobat community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:'
  text2: "Precisamos da sua ajuda para fazer desta comunidade um local que suporte todos os seus membros. Aqui está como pode ajudar:"
  text3: "Through the Catrobat project we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catrobat community by giving your projects back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their projects to you:"
  text4: 'A nossa oferta para si:'
  text5: 'Os Nossos Termos de Utilização e de Serviço:'
  list1:
    item1: de muitos diferentes países e culturas
    item2: de todas as idades (desde crianças a adolescentes e avós)
    item3: com todos os níveis de experiência
  list2:
    item1: Be respectful. When sharing projects, please remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
    item2: "Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your project's credits section. Please see the paragraph below this dotted list for details about modifying projects of other users."
    item3: "Seja honesto. Não finja ser outra pessoa nem tente enganar a comunidade."
    item4: "Mantenha privadas as suas informações pessoais. Não partilhe o seu endereço de correio electrónico, o seu número de telefone ou outras informações pessoais de contacto."
    item5: "Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, just click the 'report as inappropriate' button and leave a short explanation. The Catrobat team will review your report and may remove any project, comment, or post."
  list3:
    item1: "By uploading a project to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other projects. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded project is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms."
    item2: You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your project.
    item3: "Uma condição adicional importante é de que você dê crédito aos autores em cujos trabalhos você se baseou para criar o seu. Ao mesmo tempo, trabalharemos pesado para que seu trabalho seja igualmente apreciado por aqueles que utilizaram-no como base, por meio de crédito ao nome escolhido, livremente, por você para te representar na comunidade Catrobat; e, também, por meio da oportunidade dada aos outros de expressar gratidão a você publicamente por ter partilhado seu trabalho com a comunidade e, principalmente, com eles."
    item4: 'Por favor, consulte %link-licenseUploaded% para termos e condições legais precisos.'
  list4:
    item1: "Nós oferecemos a você, sob as licenças gratuitas do Catrobat, nossos próprios software e recursos de internet relacionados ao sistema Catrobat. Por exemplo, o software escrito pelo time Catrobat, nossos recursos de website e internet, nosso próprio código fonte e todo o material adicional, como imagens, sons e textos, agora e no futuro."
    item2: Essas licenças fazem de todo o conteúdo no Catrobat livre de custos e livre também no sentido de dar a você a liberdade de usá-los como preferir, havendo somente algumas restrições que asseguram, entre outras coisas, que o sistema Catrobat continuará sempre gratuito e útil para todos.
    item3: 'Por favor, consulte %link-licenseToPlay% para os termos e condições legais precisos. O código-fonte do sistema Catrobat, assim como muitos outros documentos e recursos, estão disponíveis via %link-developer%.'
  list5:
    item1: 'Se você, ou, se estiver abaixo de 13 anos de idade, seus pais ou tutores legais, estão associados uma organização envolvida no ou responsável por violações de privacidade tipo arrastão e/ou a granel ou a vigilância em massa, em seguida, você não tem permissão para usar nossos aplicativos de software e acessar nossos serviços. Os detalhes precisos dessa restrição e certas exceções a isso são delineados nas secções 4 e 4. b na nossa %link-termsOfUse%.'
    item2: Se você está sob 13 anos de idade, então você tem de perguntar a seus pais ou guardiões legais se eles permitem que você use aplicativos de Software e serviços do Catrobat.
    item3: "We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide projects, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catrobat's websites at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a project contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons."
    item4: "Todos os recursos de software e internet são oferecidos na esperança de que eles serão úteis, mas não há garantias."
    item5: 'Por favor, consulte nosso %link-termsOfUse% developer.catrobat.org/terms_of_use_and_service para formulações precisas dos pontos acima e alguns termos e condições legais adicionais.'
  bottom1: Retorne aqui de tempos em tempos para verificar os Termos de Utilização, porque estamos sempre a aprimorá-los.
  bottom2: 'Por favor, envie quaisquer sugestões sobre estes Termos de Utilização para %email-webmaster%.'

  text1: To offer you all the benefits of our services and the associated account, it is necessary to collect certain data from you.
  text2: To maintain and improve our services (apps and websites) and to do scientific research on ICT and STEM/STEAM education, we use Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and Firebase, all by Google LLC (USA), as well as Dynatrace by Dynatrace LLC (USA) to get metadata about the usage of our services, e.g., crash information, timestamps, visited pages/screens, usage of our apps and services, used operating system, and information about the network provider. This analysis and the collected data is not linked to your profile and does not contain any personal information (last bits of the IP address get anonymized). However, the collected data will get transferred to the service-providers (Google LLC, USA and Dynatrace LLC, USA). Data processing is based on agreements with Google LLC and Dynatrace LLC. This relationship to the service providers conforms to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and EU-USA "Privacy Shield" agreement.
  text3: To create and use an account in our systems, and to inform you about necessary changes about your account per e-mail, e.g., updates or violations of our Terms of Use and Service, our community rules, or our policies, we will store your username and, if provided by you, your e-mail address. If you have connected your account via Google Plus or Facebook, we additionally store an identification key connected to your account on these services. We will not use this data for any other (e.g., marketing) purposes, unless you explicitly allowed us to do so.
  text4: On a voluntary basis, you can give us your country of residence through your account page on the sharing site. This will get displayed on your public profile and only be used for statistical and research purposes by us. It can be removed at any time in your profile settings.
  text5: You can withdraw the usage of the personal data belonging to your account at any time by deleting your account through your profile page on https://share.catrob.at/. After deleting your account you will still be able to use the provided services, but not to collaborate, e.g., through uploading programs, commenting, or liking. Also, all provided content linked to your account, e.g., uploaded programs, comments, etc., will be deleted.
  text6: To avoid misuse of our services, e.g., through user contributed uploads or comments for illegal purposes, all user generated public data (uploads, comments) will be stored internally in a database, together with a timestamp and the used internet address. This data will not be used by or forwarded to any institutions, unless sufficiently illegal actions are reasonably suspected and officially entitled legal institutions request it based on applicable law. Each case will be thoroughly checked on an individual basis by us first.
  text7: You can voluntarily subscribe to the Catrobat Newsletter, on https://catrob.at/newsletter provided by us through the MailChimp service (The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp, USA).
