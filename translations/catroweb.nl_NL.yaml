  title: 'License to play - Give credit and share'
  text1: Imagine that each Catrobat project is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks). All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
  text2: 'There are no secret recipes: the instructions on how to make these cakes are open for anyone to use, reuse, modify, and serve as inspiration for new ideas... I mean cakes.'
  text3: "You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients. This freedom comes with two simple requirements:"
  text4: "In setting up the Catrobat community, we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning and creativity within the community. By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon one another's ideas and everyone will benefit."
  text5: In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each project page, you can always download the original scripts for the project. If you remix a project (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the project notes, mentioning the people and project that inspired you.
  text6: 'Leer meer over de gebruiksvoorwaarden van Catrobats online gemeenschap op %link-termsOfUse%.'
  list1:
    item1: share your cakes along with the recipe
    item2: give credit to those who inspired you
  version: Versie 1.1, 2 April 2013
termsOfUse:
  title: Gebruiksvoorwaarden
  headline: Welkom bij de Catrobat gemeenschap!
  text1: 'As part of the Catrobat community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:'
  text2: "We need your help to make this community a supportive place for every member. Here's how you can help:"
  text3: "Through the Catrobat project we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catrobat community by giving your projects back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their projects to you:"
  text4: 'Ons geschenk aan u:'
  text5: 'Onze algemene gebruiksvoorwaarden:'
  list1:
    item1: from many different countries and cultures
    item2: van alle leeftijden (van jonge kinderen tot tieners en grootouders)
    item3: met alle niveaus van ervaring
  list2:
    item1: Be respectful. When sharing projects, please remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
    item2: "Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your project's credits section. Please see the paragraph below this dotted list for details about modifying projects of other users."
    item3: "Wees eerlijk. Doe je niet voor als iemand anders en probeer de gemeenschap niet op andere manieren te bedriegen."
    item4: "Houd persoonlijke gegevens privaat. Maak je e-mailadres, telefoonnummer of andere contactgegevens niet bekend."
    item5: "Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, just click the 'report as inappropriate' button and leave a short explanation. The Catrobat team will review your report and may remove any project, comment, or post."
  list3:
    item1: "By uploading a project to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other projects. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded project is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms."
    item2: You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your project.
    item3: "One important additional condition is that you clearly give attribution to the authors on whose works you based your own work. At the same time, we will work hard so that your work will be clearly appreciated by others to having been contributed by you, by giving attribution to the unique name you have freely chosen to represent you in Catrobat's community, and by giving others the opportunity to express their gratitude to you in public ways for having given your work to everyone, and in particular to them."
    item4: 'Please consult %link-licenseUploaded% for the precise legal terms and conditions.'
  list4:
    item1: "We offer all our own software and Internet resources related to the Catrobat system, e.g., the software written by the Catrobat team, our websites and Internet resources, our own source code related to the Catrobat system, and all additional included materials such as, e.g., pictures, sounds, and texts, now and in the future to you under Catrobat's free licenses."
    item2: These licenses make all parts of Catrobat both free of charge to you as well as free in the sense of giving you the freedom to use them however you like, with only a few restrictions ensuring, among others, that the Catrobat system will forever remain free and useful for everyone.
    item3: 'Please consult %link-licenseToPlay% for the precise legal terms and conditions. The source code of the Catrobat system as well as many other documents and resources are available via %link-developer%.'
  list5:
    item1: 'If you, or, if you are below 13 years of age, your parents or legal guardians, are associated with an organization involved in or responsible for dragnet type privacy violations and/or bulk or mass surveillance, then you are not allowed to use our software applications and to access our services. The precise details of this restriction and certain exceptions to it are delineated in Sections 4.a and 4.b on our %link-termsOfUse%.'
    item2: If you are under 13 years of age, then you have to ask your parents or legal guardians whether they allow you to use Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services.
    item3: "We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide projects, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catrobat's websites at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a project contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons."
    item4: "All of Catrobat's software and Internet resources are offered in the hope that they will be useful, but without any warranty."
    item5: 'Please consult our %link-termsOfUse% developer.catrobat.org/terms_of_use_and_service for precise formulations of above points and some additional legal terms and conditions.'
  bottom1: Check back here from time-to-time, because we are always trying to improve our Terms of Use.
  bottom2: 'Please mail any suggestions regarding these Terms of Use to %email-webmaster%.'

  text1: To offer you all the benefits of our services and the associated account, it is necessary to collect certain data from you.
  text2: To maintain and improve our services (apps and websites) and to do scientific research on ICT and STEM/STEAM education, we use Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and Firebase, all by Google LLC (USA), as well as Dynatrace by Dynatrace LLC (USA) to get metadata about the usage of our services, e.g., crash information, timestamps, visited pages/screens, usage of our apps and services, used operating system, and information about the network provider. This analysis and the collected data is not linked to your profile and does not contain any personal information (last bits of the IP address get anonymized). However, the collected data will get transferred to the service-providers (Google LLC, USA and Dynatrace LLC, USA). Data processing is based on agreements with Google LLC and Dynatrace LLC. This relationship to the service providers conforms to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and EU-USA "Privacy Shield" agreement.
  text3: To create and use an account in our systems, and to inform you about necessary changes about your account per e-mail, e.g., updates or violations of our Terms of Use and Service, our community rules, or our policies, we will store your username and, if provided by you, your e-mail address. If you have connected your account via Google Plus or Facebook, we additionally store an identification key connected to your account on these services. We will not use this data for any other (e.g., marketing) purposes, unless you explicitly allowed us to do so.
  text4: On a voluntary basis, you can give us your country of residence through your account page on the sharing site. This will get displayed on your public profile and only be used for statistical and research purposes by us. It can be removed at any time in your profile settings.
  text5: You can withdraw the usage of the personal data belonging to your account at any time by deleting your account through your profile page on https://share.catrob.at/. After deleting your account you will still be able to use the provided services, but not to collaborate, e.g., through uploading programs, commenting, or liking. Also, all provided content linked to your account, e.g., uploaded programs, comments, etc., will be deleted.
  text6: To avoid misuse of our services, e.g., through user contributed uploads or comments for illegal purposes, all user generated public data (uploads, comments) will be stored internally in a database, together with a timestamp and the used internet address. This data will not be used by or forwarded to any institutions, unless sufficiently illegal actions are reasonably suspected and officially entitled legal institutions request it based on applicable law. Each case will be thoroughly checked on an individual basis by us first.
  text7: You can voluntarily subscribe to the Catrobat Newsletter, on https://catrob.at/newsletter provided by us through the MailChimp service (The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp, USA). You will then receive updates on the Catrobat project and its services to your provided e-mail adress. You can withdraw the newsletter at any time by using the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of every newsletter. This newsletter is provided by MailChimp with whom we do have a data-processing agreement and who committed to the EU General Data Prodection Regulation and EU-USA "Privacy Shield".
