  link: 'Licenca za predvajanje'
  title: 'Dovoljenje za predvajanje - komu se lahko zahvalite in delite'
  text1: Imagine that each Catrobat project is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks). All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
  text2: 'Ni nobenih skrivnih receptov: navodila o tem, kako narediti torte so na voljo vsakomur za uporabo, spreminjanje in navdih za nove ideje... hočem reči - torte.'
  text3: "Lahko kopirate recepte drugih in naredite lastne, morda z drugačnimi sestavinami. Ta svoboda je posledica dveh preprostih pogojev:"
  text4: "Pri vzpostavljanju skupnosti Catrobat smo se odločili, da sprejmemo ta pristop, saj smo prepričani, da podpira učenje in ustvarjalnost v skupnosti. Z delitvijo receptov in sestavin (skript in slik) lahko ljudje nadgrajujejo ideje drug drugega in vsi pridobijo."
  text5: In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each project page, you can always download the original scripts for the project. If you remix a project (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the project notes, mentioning the people and project that inspired you.
  text6: 'Več o pogojih uporabe spletne skupnosti Catrobat na %link-termsOfUse%.'
  list1:
    item1: delite vaše pecivo skupaj z receptom
    item2: zahvalite se ljudem pri katerih ste našli ideje
  version: Različica 1.1, 2 aprila 2013
termsOfUse:
  title: Pogoji uporabe
  headline: Dobrodošli v skupnosti Catrobat!
  text1: 'As part of the Catrobat community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:'
  text2: "Potrebujemo vašo pomoč, da bi bila ta skupnost podporno mesto za vsakega člana. Evo, kako lahko pomagate:"
  text3: "Through the Catrobat project we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catrobat community by giving your projects back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their projects to you:"
  text4: 'Naše darilo za vas:'
  text5: 'Naše pogoje uporabe in storitev:'
  list1:
    item1: iz številnih različnih držav in kultur
    item2: vse starosti (od majhnih otrok, najstnikov do starih staršev)
    item3: vseh ravni izkušenj
  list2:
    item1: Be respectful. When sharing projects, please remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
    item2: "Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your project's credits section. Please see the paragraph below this dotted list for details about modifying projects of other users."
    item3: "Bodite iskreni. Ne izdajajte se za osebo za katero veste, da že obstaja. Ne slepite skupnosti."
    item4: "Ne izdajajte osebnih podatkov. Ne objavljajte e-poštnega naslova, telefonske številke ali drugih podatkov."
    item5: "Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, just click the 'report as inappropriate' button and leave a short explanation. The Catrobat team will review your report and may remove any project, comment, or post."
  list3:
    item1: "By uploading a project to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other projects. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded project is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms."
    item2: You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your project.
    item3: "Pomemben dodatni pogoj je, da podate jasno Priznanje avtorstva vsem avtorjem, na katerih delu temelji vaše delo. Istočasno bo vaše delo cenjeno s strani drugih."
    item4: 'Za natančne pravne pogoje se obrnite na %link-licenseUploaded%.'
  list4:
    item1: "V uporabo ponujamo programsko opremo in vire povezane s sistemom Catrobat, npr., našo izvorno kodo, povezano z Catrobatom in vse dodatne materiale, kot so npr., slike, zvoki in besedila, zdaj in v prihodnosti pod prostim dovoljem."
    item2: Te licence zagotavljajo brezplačnost Catrobata kot tudi prostost v smislu, da ga lahko prosto uporabljate, vendar z nekaj omejitvami, ki zagotavljajo, med drugim, da bo Catrobat sistem za vedno ostal prost za vsakogar.
    item3: 'Za natančne pravne pogoje se obrnite na %link-licenseToPlay%. Izvorno kodo Catrobat sistema, kot tudi mnoge druge dokumenti in viri so na voljo prek %link-developer%.'
  list5:
    item1: 'Če ste vpleteni, ali če ste stari 13 let ali manj, so vpleteni vaši starši ali skrbniki, v organizacije odgovorne za kršitev zasebnosti in/ali množični nadzor, potem ne smete uporabljati naše programske aplikacije in dostopati do naših storitev. Podrobnosti so v razdelkih 4.a in 4.b na naših %link-termsOfUse%.'
    item2: Če ste mlajši od 13 let, potem morate imeti dovoljenje staršev ali zakonitih skrbnikov za uporabo Catrobat aplikacij in storitev.
    item3: "We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide projects, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catrobat's websites at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a project contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons."
    item4: "Vsa programska oprema in Internetni viri so na voljo v upanju, da bodo uporabni, vendar brez garancije."
    item5: 'Za natančne formulacije zgornjih točk ter nekaj dodatnih pravnih pravil in pogojev, se obrnite na naše %link-termsOfUse% developer.catrobat.org/terms_of_use_and_service.'
  bottom1: Preverite to stran od časa do časa, saj se vedno trudimo za izboljšavo naših pogojev uporabe.
  bottom2: 'Prosimo, da se za dodatne informacije glede pogojev uporabe obrnete na %email-webmaster%.'

  text1: To offer you all the benefits of our services and the associated account, it is necessary to collect certain data from you.
  text2: To maintain and improve our services (apps and websites) and to do scientific research on ICT and STEM/STEAM education, we use Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and Firebase, all by Google LLC (USA), as well as Dynatrace by Dynatrace LLC (USA) to get metadata about the usage of our services, e.g., crash information, timestamps, visited pages/screens, usage of our apps and services, used operating system, and information about the network provider. This analysis and the collected data is not linked to your profile and does not contain any personal information (last bits of the IP address get anonymized). However, the collected data will get transferred to the service-providers (Google LLC, USA and Dynatrace LLC, USA). Data processing is based on agreements with Google LLC and Dynatrace LLC. This relationship to the service providers conforms to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and EU-USA "Privacy Shield" agreement.
  text3: To create and use an account in our systems, and to inform you about necessary changes about your account per e-mail, e.g., updates or violations of our Terms of Use and Service, our community rules, or our policies, we will store your username and, if provided by you, your e-mail address. If you have connected your account via Google Plus or Facebook, we additionally store an identification key connected to your account on these services. We will not use this data for any other (e.g., marketing) purposes, unless you explicitly allowed us to do so.
  text4: On a voluntary basis, you can give us your country of residence through your account page on the sharing site. This will get displayed on your public profile and only be used for statistical and research purposes by us. It can be removed at any time in your profile settings.
  text5: You can withdraw the usage of the personal data belonging to your account at any time by deleting your account through your profile page on https://share.catrob.at/. After deleting your account you will still be able to use the provided services, but not to collaborate, e.g., through uploading programs, commenting, or liking. Also, all provided content linked to your account, e.g., uploaded programs, comments, etc., will be deleted.
  text6: To avoid misuse of our services, e.g., through user contributed uploads or comments for illegal purposes, all user generated public data (uploads, comments) will be stored internally in a database, together with a timestamp and the used internet address. This data will not be used by or forwarded to any institutions, unless sufficiently illegal actions are reasonably suspected and officially entitled legal institutions request it based on applicable law. Each case will be thoroughly checked on an individual basis by us first.
  text7: You can voluntarily subscribe to the Catrobat Newsletter, on https://catrob.at/newsletter provided by us through the MailChimp service (The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp, USA).
