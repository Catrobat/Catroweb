  title: 'Licence de jeu - Partagez et créditez'
  text1: Imagine that each Catrobat project is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks). All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
  text2: 'There are no secret recipes: the instructions on how to make these cakes are open for anyone to use, reuse, modify, and serve as inspiration for new ideas... I mean cakes.'
  text3: "You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients. This freedom comes with two simple requirements:"
  text4: "In setting up the Catrobat community, we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning and creativity within the community. By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon one another's ideas and everyone will benefit."
  text5: In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each project page, you can always download the original scripts for the project. If you remix a project (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the Project Notes, mentioning the people and project that inspired you.

  text1: 'As part of the Catrobat community, you are sharing projects and ideas with people:'
  text2: "Nous avons besoin de ton aide pour créer un endroit favorable pour tous les membres de la communauté. Voici comment tu peux aider :"
  text3: "Through the Catrobat project we want to foster cooperation and allow everyone's creativity to combine for the benefit of all of humanity. You also can become an active member of the Catrobat community by giving your projects back to the community as a gift, in the same way as other active members are giving their projects to you:"
  text4: 'Un cadeau pour toi :'
  text5: 'Conditions d''utilisation et d''entretien :'
  list1:
    item1: de beaucoup de pays et cultures diverses
    item2: de tous les âges (jeunes enfants, adolescents et grands-parents)
    item3: avec tous les niveaux d'expérience
  list2:
    item1: Be respectful. When sharing projects, please remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
    item2: "Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people's projects - just make sure to give them credit. One place to give credit is in your project's credits section. Please see the paragraph below this dotted list for details about modifying projects of other users."
    item3: "Être honnête. Ne fais pas semblant d'être quelqu'un d'autre et n'essaye pas de tromper la communauté."
    item4: "Ne partage pas d'informations privées. Notamment l'adesse e-mail, le numéro de téléphone ou d'autres informations de contact."
    item5: "Help keep the site friendly. If you feel others would find a project or comment mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, just click the 'report as inappropriate' button and leave a short explanation. The Catrobat team will review your report and may remove any project, comment, or post."
  list3:
    item1: "By uploading a project to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other projects. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded project is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms."
    item2: You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your project.
    item3: "Si tu utilises et modifies des applis des autres utilisateurs, il faut les mentionner explicitement. Le nom que tu as sélectionné pour ton compte Catrobat sera aussi mentionné si quelqu'un utilise et modifie tes applis. Ainsi tout le monde peut profiter du travail de chacun."
    item4: 'Pour les conditions juridiques précises, veuillez consulter %link-licenseUploaded%.'
  list4:
    item1: "Nous t'offrons nos applications et ressources Internet liées au système Catrobat comme par exemple des applications créees par l'équipe Catrobat, nos sites webs et ressources disponibles sur Internet, notre code source lié au système Catrobat et des matériaux supplémentaires comme par exemple des images, des sons et des texts maintenant et à l'avenir sous des licences libres de Catrobat."
    item2: Ces licences nous permettent d'offrir Catrobat gratuitement. Grâce à ces licences, il est aussi possible d'utiliser et de modifier nos applications à ton gré. Il n'y a que quelques restrictions pour assurer que le système Catrobat reste libre et utile pour tout le monde pour toujours.
    item3: 'Please consult %link-licenseToPlay% for the precise legal terms and conditions. The source code of the Catrobat system as well as many other documents and resources are available via %link-developer%.'
  list5:
    item1: 'If you, or, if you are below 13 years of age, your parents or legal guardians, are associated with an organization involved in or responsible for dragnet type privacy violations and/or bulk or mass surveillance, then you are not allowed to use our software applications and to access our services. The precise details of this restriction and certain exceptions to it are delineated in Sections 4.a and 4.b on our %link-termsOfUse%.'
    item2: Si tu as moins de 13 ans, il faut demander tes parents ou ton tuteur légal si tu peux utiliser les logiciels et services Catrobat.
    item3: "We reserve the rights to reject, delete, or hide projects, user accounts, and any digital materials uploaded to Catrobat's websites at any time in our sole discretion, for instance if we find that a project contains inappropriate material or that a user infringes on the rights of other persons."
    item4: "Les logiciels et ressources Internet Catrobat ont pour but d'être utiles. Pourtant, nous donnons aucune garantie."
    item5: 'Please consult our %link-termsOfUse% developer.catrobat.org/terms_of_use_and_service for precise formulations of above points and some additional legal terms and conditions.'

      During the creation of the postcard, the basics of Pocket Code that you need for your future projects are mediated.
      After these guided videos, all other activities will give you more freedom to create your own personal Pocket Code projects.
