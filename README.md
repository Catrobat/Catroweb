# Catroweb

Catroweb is the name of the "Pocket Code" [sharing platform](https://share.catrob.at/app/), where our community can upload their projects. If you uploaded your game in the previous step, it should already be visible to all other users. They can now download and remix your masterpiece. Additionally, the platform provides users with features typical for a social network.

## Team Culture

We work as a team and expect everyone to follow the rules. In our daily work, we use the methods listed below to create high-quality code. We support each other but also anticipate newcomers to learn about our coding principles proactively:
