# Catroweb

Catroweb is the name of the **Pocket Code sharing platform**, where our community uploads and shares projects.  
If you uploaded your game in a previous step, it should already be visible to other users.

They can download and remix your masterpiece, while the platform also provides features typical of a social network.

You can find our API specifications here:

## Team Culture

We work as a team and expect everyone to follow shared rules and best practices to ensure high-quality code.

Focus on, Test-Driven Development, Clean Code and quality Code Reviews.
