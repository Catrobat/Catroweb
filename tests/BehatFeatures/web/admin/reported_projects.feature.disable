Feature: Admin reported programs
  It should be possible to list all reported programs, unreport them and edit their visible status

  Background:
    Given there are admins:
      | name  | password | token      | email                | id |
      | Admin | 123456   | eeeeeeeeee | admin@pocketcode.org | 1  |
    And there are users:
      | name     | password | token      | email               | id |
      | Superman | 123456   | cccccccccc | dev1@pocketcode.org | 2  |
      | Gregor   | 123456   | dddddddddd | dev2@pocketcode.org | 3  |
    And there are programs:
      | id | name      | description             | visible | owned by |
      | 1  | program 1 | my superman description | true    | Gregor   |
      | 2  | program 2 | abcef                   | true    | Superman |
      | 3  | program 3 | hello                   | true    | Gregor   |

  Scenario: List reported programs sorted by date descending
    Given I log in as "Admin" with the password "123456"
    And I report program 1 with category "spam" and note "Bad Program" in Browser
    And I report program 2 with category "spam" and note "Even Worse Program" in Browser
    And I am on "/admin/reported_projects/list"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see the reported programs table:
      | Note               | State | Category | Reporting User | Program   | Program Visible |
      | Even Worse Program | New   | Spam     | Admin          | program 2 | no              |
      | Bad Program        | New   | Spam     | Admin          | program 1 | no              |

  Scenario: Report another program and list should still be sorted by date descending
    Given I log in as "Admin" with the password "123456"
    And I report program 1 with category "spam" and note "Bad Program" in Browser
    And I report program 2 with category "spam" and note "Even Worse Program" in Browser

      | Bad Program        | New   | Spam     | Admin          | program 1 | no              |
    Then I report program 3 with category "dislike" and note "Pure Filth" in Browser
    And I am on "/admin/reported_projects/list"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see the reported programs table:
      | Note               | State | Category | Reporting User | Program   | Program Visible |
      | Pure Filth         | New   | Dislike  | Admin          | program 3 | no              |
      | Even Worse Program | New   | Spam     | Admin          | program 2 | no              |
      | Bad Program        | New   | Spam     | Admin          | program 1 | no              |
