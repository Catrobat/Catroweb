Feature: Persist project and comment machine translation

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name     |
      | 1  | Catrobat |
    And there are projects:
      | id | name     | owned by | description  | credit  |
      | 1  | project1 | Catrobat |              |         |
      | 2  | project2 | Catrobat |              |         |
      | 3  | project3 | Catrobat | description3 | credit3 |
    And there are comments:
      | id | program_id | user_id | text |
      | 1  | 2          | 1       | c1   |
      | 2  | 1          | 1       | c2   |

  Scenario: Create new entry the first time a program is translated
