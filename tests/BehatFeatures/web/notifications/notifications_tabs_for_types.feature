Feature: User gets notifications for new followers, reactions, comments, ..


  Background:
    Given there are users:

    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I open the menu
    And I click "#sidebar-notifications"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should be on "/app/user_notifications"
    And I should see "It looks like you don't have any notifications."
    And the element "#all-notif" should be visible
    And the element "#follow-notif" should be visible
    And the element "#reaction-notif" should be visible
    And the element "#comment-notif" should be visible
    And the element "#remix-notif" should be visible

    Given I log in as "Catrobat"
    And I am on "/app/user_notifications"

    And I should see "User commented on program 1."
