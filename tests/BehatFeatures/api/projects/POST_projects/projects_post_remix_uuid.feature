Feature: Upload a remixed program with multiple parents should also work with the new UUIDs

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name     | password |
      | 1  | Catrobat | 123456   |

    And there are programs:

    # this is how the remix graph looks like according to the following forward remix relations (closure table):
    #

    #                    \ /    /         /
