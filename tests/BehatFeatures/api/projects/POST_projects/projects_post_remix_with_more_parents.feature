    # this is how the remix graph should look like after the program is uploaded:
    #
    #             (1) (SCRATCH #1)
    #               \ /
    #               (2)_____
    #               / \     \   (SCRATCH #2)
    #             (3) (4)   |____/
    #              | \ |    |     (8)
    #             (5) (6)__/|_____/ \
    #               \ / \  /       (9)
    #               (7) (10)            <-- to be added (uploaded program will get ID "10")
    #
    # Note: there are some additional remix backward relations (see table above) not shown in the graph for clarity reasons.
    #       This test will also check that no backward parents of parent program will be linked to the uploaded program.

    Given I have a program with "catrobatLanguageVersion" set to "1.1" and "url" set to "The Colour Divide - Trailer [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/70058680/], Merge 2 [Program 2 [/pocketalice/project/2], Merge 1 [Program 6 [/app/project/6], Program 8 [https://share.catrob.at/app/project/8]]]"
