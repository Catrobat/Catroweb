Feature: Upload a remixed project with multiple parents

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name     | password |
      | 1  | Catrobat | 123456   |

    And there are projects:
      | id | name      | description | owned by | downloads | views | upload time      | version | remix_root |
      | 1  | project 1 | p1          | Catrobat | 3         | 12    | 01.01.2013 12:00 | 0.8.5   | true       |

    # this is how the remix graph looks like according to the following forward remix relations (closure table):

    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And there are forward remix relations:

    And there are Scratch remix relations:
      | scratch_parent_id | catrobat_child_id |
      | 29495624          | 5                 |
