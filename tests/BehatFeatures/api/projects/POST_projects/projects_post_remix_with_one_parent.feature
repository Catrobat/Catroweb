  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name     | password |
      | 1  | Catrobat | 12345    |

    And there are programs:
      | id | name      | description | owned by | downloads | views | upload time      | version | remix_root |
      | 1  | program 1 | p1          | Catrobat | 3         | 12    | 01.01.2013 12:00 | 0.8.5   | true       |

    # this is how the remix graph looks like according to the following forward remix relations (closure table):
    #              (1)
    #               \
    #               (2)
    #               /
    #             (3)
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And there are forward remix relations:
      | ancestor_id | descendant_id | depth |
      | 1           | 1             | 0     |
      | 1           | 2             | 1     |

      | 3           | 3             | 0     |

  Scenario: program upload with no parent-URL should not add any remix relations (except self referencing relation)
    Given I have a program with "url" set to ""

  (except self referencing relation)

    Given I have a program with "url" set to "/pocketalice/project/5"
    When I upload the program with the id "10", API version 2
    Then the uploaded program should not be a remix root, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have remix migration date NOT NULL, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have a Catrobat forward ancestor having its own id and depth "0", API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have a Catrobat forward ancestor having id "5" and depth "1", API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have a Catrobat forward ancestor having id "4" and depth "2", API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have no further Catrobat forward ancestors, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have no Catrobat backward parents, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have no Scratch parents, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have no Catrobat forward descendants except self-relation, API version 2
    And the uploaded program should have RemixOf "/pocketalice/project/5" in the xml, API version 2

  Scenario: custom graph with backward relation to parent given (example #3)
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # this is how the remix graph looks like (closure table):
    #
    #               (4)    (SCRATCH) ___
    #                 \    /  |  \      \
    #                  \  /   |   \      |
    #                  (5)    /  (7)     |
    #                    \   /__/ | \    |
    #                     \ /     | (10) |    <-- to be added (uploaded program will get ID "10")
    #                     (6)    (8)____/
    #                       \    /
    #                        (9)
    #
    # Note: unlike the previous example there is an additional remix backward relation from program #9 to
    #       the program #7, in this example. But this is not drawn in the graph above for clarity reasons.
    #       Since program #7 will be the parent of the uploaded program #10, this test will also check that no ancestors
    #       of program #9 (including itself) are linked to the uploaded program.

    Given there are forward remix relations:
      | ancestor_id | descendant_id | depth |
      | 4           | 4             | 0     |
      | 5           | 5             | 0     |
      | 6           | 6             | 0     |
      | 7           | 7             | 0     |
      | 8           | 8             | 0     |
      | 9           | 9             | 0     |
      | 4           | 5             | 1     |
      | 4           | 6             | 2     |
      | 4           | 9             | 2     |
      | 4           | 9             | 3     |
      | 5           | 6             | 1     |
      | 5           | 9             | 2     |
      | 6           | 9             | 1     |
      | 7           | 6             | 1     |
      | 7           | 8             | 1     |
      | 7           | 9             | 2     |
      | 8           | 9             | 1     |

    And there are backward remix relations:
      | parent_id | child_id |
      | 9         | 7        |

    And there are Scratch remix relations:
      | scratch_parent_id | catrobat_child_id |
      | 70058680          | 5                 |
