  Scenario: All categories should be returned
    Given I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I have a request header "Accept-Language" with value "de"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/categories"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    And the response should contain all categories

  Scenario: Get response without language header
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/categories"
    Then the response status code should be "406"
