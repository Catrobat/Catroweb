  Scenario: Search for projects with specific word

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "Galaxy"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the default projects model structure
    Then the response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name       |
      | Galaxy War |

  Scenario: Private projects must not appear in the results

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "Fisch"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the default projects model structure
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      []
      """

  Scenario: Hidden projects must not appear in the results

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "Ponny description2"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"

  Scenario: Search for project with specific extension

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "arduino"

      | Name       |
      | ponny      |
      | Galaxy War |
      | Webteam    |


  Scenario: Search for project with specific extension with max_version = 0.984
    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "arduino"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search/?max_version=0.984"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the default projects model structure
    Then the response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name       |
      | Galaxy War |

  Scenario: Search for project with specific extension with max_version = 0.984 and with specified attributes
    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "arduino"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I have a parameter "max_version" with value "0.984"
    And I have a parameter "attributes" with value "id,name,description,author"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search/"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
