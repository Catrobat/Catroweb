  Scenario: Get specific project
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/project/1"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the project model structure
    Then the response should contain the following project:
      | Name       |
      | project 1  |


  Scenario: Get specific project
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/project/2"
