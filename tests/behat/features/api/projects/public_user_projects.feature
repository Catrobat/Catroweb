  Scenario: Get user public projects
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/user/user-1/"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the projects model structure
    Then the response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | project 1 |
      | project 10|
      | project 3 |
      | project 6 |
      | project 7 |
      | project 9 |

  Scenario: Get user public projects with limit = 1 and offset = 0
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"

    Then the response status code should be "200"
