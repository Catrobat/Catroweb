@api @user
Feature: Search users

  To find users, users should be able to search all available users for specific words

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | name         | password | token      | id |
      | Catrobat     | 12345    | cccccccccc | 1  |
      | User1        | vwxyz    | aaaaaaaaaa | 2  |
      | NewUser      | 54321    | bbbbbbbbbb | 3  |
      | Catroweb     | 54321    | bbbbbbbbbb | 4  |
      | пользователь | 54321    | bbbbbbbbbb | 5  |
    And there are followers:
      | name     | following      |
      | Catrobat | User1, Catroweb|
      | NewUser  | Catrobat       |
      | Catroweb | User1, NewUser |
    And there are programs:
      | id        | name            | owned by | version | private | visible |
      | isxs-adkt | Webteam         | Catroweb | 0.8.5   | false   | true    |
      | tvut-irkw | Catroweb        | NewUser  | 0.8.5   | false   | true    |
    And I wait 1000 milliseconds

  Scenario: Search for users with specific word in username

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "Catro"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/users/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the users model structure
    Then the response should contain users in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Catrobat  |
      | Catroweb  |

  Scenario: Search for users with specific word in username

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "NewUser"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/users/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    Then the response should have the users model structure
    Then the response should contain users in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | NewUser   |

    Then the response should have the users model structure
    Then the response should contain users in the following order:
      | Name        |
      | пользователь|

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "2"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/users/search"
    Then the response status code should be "200"

    Then the response should contain users in the following order:

  Scenario: Search for users with specific word should only return users

    Given I have a parameter "query" with value "Catroweb"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
