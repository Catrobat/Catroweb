@api @upload
Feature: Upload a program to the website

  Background:

    Given there are users:
      | name     | password | token      | id |
      | Catrobat | 12345    | cccccccccc | 1  |
      | User1    | vwxyz    | aaaaaaaaaa | 2  |

  Scenario: Upload program
    Given the HTTP Request:
      | Method | POST                        |
      | Url    | /app/api/upload/upload.json |
    And the POST parameters:
      | Name         | Value                  |
      | username     | Catrobat               |
      | token        | cccccccccc             |
      | fileChecksum | <md5 checksum of file> |
    And I have a valid Catrobat file, API version 1
    And the POST parameter "fileChecksum" contains the MD5 sum of the attached file
    When the Request is invoked
    Then the returned json object with id "1" will be:
          """
          {
            "projectId": "1",
            "statusCode": 200,
            "answer": "Your project was uploaded successfully!",
            "token": "cccccccccc",
            "preHeaderMessages": ""
          }
          """

  Scenario Outline: Troubleshooting
    Given the upload problem "<problem>"
    When such a Request is invoked
    Then I should get the json object:
          """
          {
            "statusCode": <errorcode>,
            "answer": "<answer>",
            "preHeaderMessages": ""
          }
          """

    Examples:
      | problem              | errorcode | answer                            |
      | missing parameters   | 501       | POST-data not correct or missing! |
      | invalid program file | 505       | invalid file                      |
