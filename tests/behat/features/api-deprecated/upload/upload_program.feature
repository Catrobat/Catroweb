  Scenario: program upload with valid data
    Given I have a parameter "username" with value "Catrobat"
    And I have a parameter "token" with value "cccccccccc"
    And I have a valid Catrobat file, API version 1
    And I have a parameter "fileChecksum" with the md5checksum of "test.catrobat"
    When I POST these parameters to "/app/api/upload/upload.json"
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      {"projectId":"REGEX_STRING_WILDCARD","statusCode":200,"answer":"Your project was uploaded successfully!","token":"REGEX_STRING_WILDCARD","preHeaderMessages":""}
      """

  Scenario: trying to upload with a missing token should result in an error

  Scenario: uploading the same project again should result in an update
    Given I am "Catrobat"
    When I upload a valid Catrobat project, API version 1
    And I upload a valid Catrobat project with the same name, API version 1
    Then the uploaded project should exist in the database, API version 1
    And it should be updated, API version 1

  Scenario: program with missing file checksum are rejected
    Given I have a parameter "username" with value "Catrobat"
    And I have a parameter "token" with value "cccccccccc"

    When I POST these parameters to "/app/api/upload/upload.json"
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      {"statusCode":503,"answer":"Client did not send fileChecksum! Are you using an outdated version of Pocket Code?","preHeaderMessages":""}

    And I have a parameter "token" with value "cccccccccc"

    And I have a parameter "fileChecksum" with an invalid md5checksum of my file
    When I POST these parameters to "/app/api/upload/upload.json"
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      {"statusCode":504,"answer":"invalid checksum","preHeaderMessages":""}

  Scenario: Token is not changing on upload

    And I am "Catrobat"
    And I upload a valid Catrobat project, API version 1
    When I upload another program using token "cccccccccc"
    Then the uploaded project should exist in the database, API version 1

  Scenario: Program Sanitizer should remove unnecessary files
    Given I try to upload a project with unnecessary files, API version 1
