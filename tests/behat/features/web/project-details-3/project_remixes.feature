Feature: As a visitor I want to see the full remix graph of a program on the program page

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name     |
      | 1  | Superman |
      | 2  | Gangster |
    And there are projects:
      | id | name      | description             | owned by | downloads | apk_downloads | views | upload time      | version | language version | visible | remix_root | debug |
      | 1  | project 1 | my superman description | Superman | 3         | 2             | 12    | 01.01.2013 12:00 | 0.8.5   | 0.94             | true    | true       | false |

      | 3  | project 3 | abcef                   | Gangster | 333       | 3             | 9     | 22.04.2014 13:00 | 0.8.5   | 0.93             | true    | false      | false |

    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # this is how the remix graph looks like according to the following forward remix relations (closure table):
    #              (1)
    #               \
    #               (2)_____
    #               / \     \
    #             (3) (4)   |       (8)
    #              | \ |    |        |
    #             (5) (6)__/        (9)
    #               \ /
    #               (7)
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And there are forward remix relations:
      | ancestor_id | descendant_id | depth |
      | 1           | 1             | 0     |
      | 1           | 2             | 1     |

      | 1           | 4             | 2     |
      | 1           | 5             | 3     |
      | 1           | 6             | 2     |
      | 1           | 6             | 3     |

      | 2           | 6             | 1     |
      | 2           | 6             | 2     |
      | 2           | 7             | 2     |

      | 9           | 9             | 0     |
