    And I am on "/app/project/1"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I click "#project-like-detail-small .btn[data-like-type=1]"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I am on "/app/project/3"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I click "#project-like-detail-small .btn[data-like-type=1]"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I am on "/app/user_notifications"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then the element "#catro-notification-1" should not exist
    And I should not see "OtherUser reacted to otherPro."
