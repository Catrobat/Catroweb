Feature: As a visitor I want to see code statistics on the project page

  Scenario: For performance reasons the code statistics are on its own page
    Given there are programs:
      | id | name      |
      | 1  | program 1 |
    And I am on "/app/project/1"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I click "#code-statistics-small"
    Then I should be on "/app/project/1/code_statistics"
    And the "#top-app-bar__title" element should contain "Code statistics"

  Scenario: Code statistics provide means to return to the project page
    Given there are programs:
      | id | name      |
      | 1  | program 1 |
    And I am on "/app"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    When I go to "/app/project/1/code_statistics"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I click "#top-app-bar__back__btn-back"
    Then I should be on "/app/project/1"

  Scenario: Code statistics page title is no link
    Given there are programs:
      | id | name      |
      | 1  | program 1 |
    And I am on "/app/project/1/code_statistics"
    And I click "#top-app-bar__title"
    Then I should be on "/app/project/1/code_statistics"

  Scenario: The code statistics should use an accordion principle
    Given I have a project zip "CodeStatistics/code_statistics_compound_blocks.catrobat"
    And I upload this generated program with id "1", API version 1
    And I am on "/app/project/1/code_statistics"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then the element "#statisticsGeneral" should be visible
