  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | id | name      |
      | 1  | Catrobat  |
      | 2  | User      |
      | 3  | Drago     |

      | 1  | program 1 | Catrobat |
      | 2  | program 2 | User     |
      | 3  | program 3 | Drago    |

  Scenario: User should see the amount of his notifications in the menu only if he has notifications
    Given I log in as "OtherUser"

    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    When I open the menu
    Then the element "#notifications-dropdown-toggler" should be visible
    But the element "#notifications-dropdown-toggler .badge-pill" should not be visible

    And the element ".all-notifications-dropdown" should be visible
