    Then the element "#delete-account-button" should not be visible
    When I click "#account-settings-button"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then the element "#delete-account-button" should be visible
    When I click "#delete-account-button"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see "Account Deletion"
    When I click ".swal2-confirm"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should be logged out
    And the user "Catrobat" should not exist
    And I log in as "User1" with the password "123456"
    And I am on "/app/user"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then the element "#delete-account-button" should not be visible
    When I click "#account-settings-button"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then the element "#delete-account-button" should be visible
    When I click "#delete-account-button"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see "Account Deletion"
    When I click ".swal2-confirm"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should be logged out
    And the user "User1" should not exist
    And comments or catro notifications should not exist

  Scenario: When changing the username it shouldn't contain an email address
    Given I click "#edit-username-button"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    When I fill in "username" with "catro catro@gmail.com"
    And I click "#save-username"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should be on "/app/user"
    And I should see "Username shouldn't contain an email address."
    When I go to "/app/logout"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I log in as "Mr"
    Then I should see "Your password or username was incorrect."
