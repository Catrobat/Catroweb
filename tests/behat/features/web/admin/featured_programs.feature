  Scenario: Adding a featured Program with URL - Project (fail)
    Given I log in as "Adminius" with the password "123456"
    And I am on "/admin/featured_program/list"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see the featured table:
      | Id | Program                  | Url | Flavor      | Priority   |
      | 1  | program 1 (#1337-c0ffee) |     | pocketcode  | 1          |

    And I click on the "new" link
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should be on "/admin/featured_program/create"

    Then I write "catrobat.at/app/project/dead-b00f" in textarea with label "Program Id Or Url"
    Then I write "3" in textarea with label "Priority"
    Then I click ".btn-success"
    Then I should see "Error"
    And I am on "/admin/featured_program/list"
    Then I should see the featured table:
