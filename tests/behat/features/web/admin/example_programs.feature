 @admin
    Feature: Admin example programs
      It should be possible to list all example programs, sort and filter etc.

      Background:
        Given there are admins:
          | name     | password | token      | email                | id |
          | Adminius | 123456   | eeeeeeeeee | admin@pocketcode.org |  0 |

        And there are users:
          | name      | password | token      | email               | id |
          | Superman  | 123456   | cccccccccc | dev1@pocketcode.org |  1 |
          | Gregor    | 123456   | dddddddddd | dev2@pocketcode.org |  2 |
          | Frank Jr. | 123456   | qwertyuiop | dev3@pocketcode.org |  3 |

        And there are programs:
          | id           | name      | description             | owned by  | downloads | apk_downloads | views | upload time      | version | language version | visible | apk_ready |
          | 1337-c0ffee  | program 1 | my superman description | Superman  | 3         | 2             | 12    | 01.01.2013 12:00 | 0.8.5   | 0.94             | true    | true      |

          | b100d-c01d   | program 4 | abc                     | Superman  | 333       | 3             | 9     | 22.04.2014 13:00 | 0.8.5   | 0.93             | true    | true      |
          | dead-beef    | to add    | add me if u can         | Frank Jr. | 123       | 3             | 9     | 22.04.2014 13:00 | 0.8.5   | 0.93             | true    | true      |

        And there are flavors:
          | id | name       |
          | 1  | arduino    |
          | 2  | embroidery |

        And following programs are examples:
          | name      | active | priority | flavor     | ios_only |
          | program 1 | 0      | 1        | arduino    |   yes    |
          | program 2 | 1      | 2        | embroidery |   no     |
          | program 3 | 1      | 3        | embroidery |   no     |
          | program 4 | 1      | 3        | arduino    |   no     |

      Scenario: List all example programs:
        Given I log in as "Adminius" with the password "123456"
        And I am on "/admin/example_program/list"
        And I wait for the page to be loaded
        Then I should see the example table:
          | Id | Program                  | Flavor     | Priority   |
          | 1  | program 1 (#1337-c0ffee) | arduino    | 1          |

          | 4  | program 4 (#b100d-c01d)  | arduino    | 3          |
        And I should not see "Adminius"

      Scenario: Delete first example Program
        Given I log in as "Adminius" with the password "123456"
        And I am on "/admin/example_program/list"

          | 4  | program 4 (#b100d-c01d)  | arduino    | 3          |
        Then I am on "/admin/example_program/1/delete"
        And I wait for the page to be loaded
        Then I click on the first ".btn-danger" button
        And I wait for the page to be loaded

          | 4  | program 4 (#b100d-c01d)  | arduino    | 3          |
        And I should not see "Adminius"
        And I should not see "program 1"

      Scenario: Click on program link
        Given I log in as "Adminius" with the password "123456"

          | 4  | program 4 (#b100d-c01d)  | arduino    | 3          |
        And I click on the "program 1 (#1337-c0ffee)" link
        And I wait for the page to be loaded
        Then I should see "Edit \"program 1 (#1337-c0ffee)\""

      Scenario: Adding an example Program (success)
        Given I log in as "Adminius" with the password "123456"
