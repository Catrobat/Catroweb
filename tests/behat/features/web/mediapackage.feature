  Scenario: Viewing defined categories in a specific package
    Given I am on "/app/media-library/looks"

  Scenario: Viewing only media files for the pocketcode flavor
    Given I am on "/app/media-library/looks"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see media file with id "1"
    And I should see media file with id "5"
    And I should see media file with id "6"
    But I should not see media file with id "4"
    And I should not see media file with id "7"
    And I should not see a "#category-theme-special" element

  Scenario: When using Luna-Flavor, there should be a theme-special category
    Given I am on "/luna/media-library/looks"
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Then I should see a "#category-theme-special" element
    And I should see media file with id 7 in category "Luna & Cat Theme Special"
    And I should see 1 media file in category "Luna & Cat Theme Special"
    And I should see 1 media file in category "Bla"

    And I click "#start-downloads"
    Then I should receive a file named "Dog (-).png"
